Quick Start
===========
Here we give a very quick rundown of the basic links and information sources
for the project.

Basic Installation
------------------
In the Menpo Team, we **strongly** advocate the usage of conda for scientific
Python, as it makes installation of compiled binaries much more simple. In
particular, if you wish to use any of the related Menpo projects such as
*menpofit*, *menpo3d* or *menpodetect*, you will not be able to easily do so
without using conda. The installation of MenpoFit using conda is as easy as

::

    $ conda install -c menpo menpofit

Conda is able to work out all the requirements/dependencies of MenpoFit. You
may for example notice that *menpo* is one of them. Please see the thorough
installation instructions for each platform on the `Menpo website <http://www
.menpo.org/installation/>`_.

API Documentation
-----------------
:ref:`Visit API Documentation <api-index>`

MenpoFit is extensively documented on a per-method/class level and much
of this documentation is reflected in the API Documentation.
If any functions or classes are missing, please bring it to the attention
of the developers on `Github <https://github.com/menpo/menpofit>`_.

Notebooks
---------
`Explore the Menpo and MenpoFit Notebooks <http://www.menpo.org/notebooks
.html>`_

For a more thorough set of examples, we provide a set of Jupyter notebooks
that demonstrate common use cases of MenpoFit. The notebooks include
extensive examples regarding all the state-of-the-art deformable models that we
provide. You may need to have a look at the Menpo notebooks in order to get
an overview of the basic functionalities required by MenpoFit.

User Group and Issues
---------------------
If you wish to get in contact with the Menpo developers, you can do so
via various channels. If you have found a bug, or if any part of MenpoFit
behaves in a way you do not expect, please raise an issue on
`Github <https://github.com/menpo/menpofit>`_.

If you want to ask a theoretical question, or are having problems installing
or setting up MenpoFit, please visit the
